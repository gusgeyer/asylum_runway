# asylum_runway
This project is an original sound-based prototype created in TunePad. It produces a haunted, fast-paced runway soundtrack inspired by Alexander McQueen’s Voss collection. The composition layers drums, cymbals, brass, bass, and eerie synth chords to explore rhythm and emotion through creative coding.

How to Run:
Open the .tunepad file in TunePad
Ensure all included tracks (drums, cymbals, soft synth, bass, eerie synth) are assigned correctly in “Tracks” mode.
Press Run All Cells to hear the full composition.
